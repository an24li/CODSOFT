## 🔍 1. CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

### 📌 Objective:
Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a subscription-based service using historical customer data, including features such as demographics and usage behavior.

### 📂 Dataset:
- `Churn_Modelling.csv` (contains features like Age, Balance, Tenure, Geography, Gender, etc.)

### ⚙️ Algorithms Used:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

### 📊 Evaluation:
- Accuracy, F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Bar Plot Comparison of Models

## 💳 2. CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

### 📌 Objective:
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of anonymized transaction data.

### 📂 Dataset:
- [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)

### ⚙️ Algorithms Used:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier

### 📊 Evaluation:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC Score  
- Confusion Matrix and Classification Report

## 📩 3. SPAM SMS DETECTION

### 📌 Objective:
Classify SMS text messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using Natural Language Processing techniques.

### 📂 Dataset:
- [UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)

### ⚙️ Techniques Used:
- Text Preprocessing (tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation removal)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### 📊 Evaluation:
- Accuracy, F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Word Cloud and Model Comparison
